We just publish our local git repo 
to remote GitHub.com repository

Few thing happened :
1. It automatically created new Remote Repo
   under your GitHub.com account 
2. Made the collection with your local git repo
3. Added all your commits to remote repo

Now our work will continue locally

1. Add a new file called note.txt
2. Commited the change to local repo
3. We want this change to be reflected in
remote repository so we PUSHED local commits to
remote repository using push origin button 
4. Observe it has been added in your repository
under GitHub.com
